# SharpMusic

A script that uses a webcam to watch you play piano. It determines the note sequence and outputs a pdf of sheet music.

Limitations: can only see a couple octaves of the piano and doesn't incorporate tempo (has fixed tempo with only quarter notes)

Overall, was a really fun experience to play with these technologies at our first hackathon!
