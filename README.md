# SharpMusic

A prototype for a piano music transcriber that uses a novel computer vision approach.

By taking a video of your piano as you play, you can use _getNotes2.py_ to extract the notes as sheet music.

Below, you can see a demonstration of the script. It shows the piano key detection, with the currently pressed key displayed in big text.

Limitations: can only see white keys for a couple octaves of the piano and doesn't incorporate tempo (has fixed tempo with only quarter notes)

Overall, was a really fun experience to play with these technologies at our first hackathon!
